baseline/cpu:
timer0 → sequential reference implementation
timer1 → OpenMP implementation

PIM:
timer0 → transfer graph CPU → DPU
timer1 → transfer config CPU → DPU
timer2 → frontier calculations on DPU
timer3 → retrieve frontier from DPUs, calculate the next one, and send it back
timer4 → retrieve results from DPUs
